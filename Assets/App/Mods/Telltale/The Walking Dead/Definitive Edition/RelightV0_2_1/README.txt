Hi, you have downloaded the Relight Mod!

=========== INSTALLATION ===========
To install the mod, please do the following.

1. Extract the contents of the "MOVE_CONTENTS_TO_GAME_ARCHIVES_FOLDER" folder (the files inside of the folder) and place them into your game "Archives" directory. The archives directory has all of the .ttarch2 and "_resdesc_".lua files and it is located in your main game directory.

2. Open the "MOVE_FOLDERS_INSIDE_TO_GAME_DIRECTORY" folder and move the FOLDERS that are inside this folder ("RelightLevels" and "RelightMod") into the GAME DIRECTORY. 
I repeat... DO NOT MOVE THE FILES THAT ARE INSIDE "RelightLevels" OR "RelightMod" INTO THE GAME DIRECTORY, MOVE THE FOLDERS "RelightLevels" and "RelightMod" TO THE GAME DIRECTORY.
The game directory is also where the main WDC.exe (or main game .exe file) is stored.

=========== ISSUE/BUG REPORTING ===========
If you run into any issues with the mod... please PLEASE report such issues either to the relight mod nexus page, or the github page...

When reporting issues/bugs please be as SPECIFIC as humanly possible. If you are not specific enough then I will have no idea how to reproduce the issues that you ran into, and thus very likely your issue will not get fixed... because you haven't given me enough information!!! 

I need to know all of the steps you did to get to that point (i.e. details like: what mods do you have installed for the game? | where did you install relight? | did you install relight correctly? | what level and season are you playing that is having issues, and what kind of issues? | if you have performance problems what are your PC specs and what levels are causing performance issues? | etc.) I can't list all of the possible questions but you get the idea, the more information I have the better and more quickly I can reproduce your issue and fix it for the next mod release whenever that may be.
